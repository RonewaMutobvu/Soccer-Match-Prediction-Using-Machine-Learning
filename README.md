# Soccer-Match-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

In Europe, football is the most popular sports followed by millions of people, where most
countries have football competitive leagues consisting of 20 teams each season. The top five
European leagues are the English premier league, La-Liga, Ligue 1,Bundesliga, and Serie A.
Football match has three possible outcomes in each game; away team win, home team win, or
the game ends in a draw. Amongst the top five European leagues, the Italian Serie A is ranked
third behind the English premier league and La Liga. Teams such as Juventus, Milan, Inter
Milan, Napoli, and Roma have earned Serie A its treasured status due to their frequent European
football participation against other top ranked football teams across different leagues.

We used Europe datasets to make predictions 

MOTIVATION 

Machine learning methods can be applied to different fields, including sports. On the example of
English Premier League it is shown that it is possible to find a classifier that predicts the
outcome of soccer matches with the precision of more than 60 percent Yezus A, (2014).There
are lots of claims from multiple studies about the prediction. This project focus in the predictions
accuracy of the results of the Serie A league by using various machine learning methods. This
will fill the gap in the betting world for most people who are participating in the betting world.
The project depending on the prediction accuracy, will help the participants of the betting world
and the fans for the serie A league to have the expectations before the game starts using the
algorithm. Predicting the outcomes of a football match has always been something spectators
enjoy doing, by coming up with anticipated starting lineups, team form, and other different
statistics to support their predictions. Similarly, football match betting has been carried out with
a great deal of interest by fans, of which some of them rely on betting winning’s as their primary
source of income. If there is a way to evaluate different football match statistics to assist in
making predictions about match outcomes, it will be highly advantageous to the betters to help in
making informed betting’s.
